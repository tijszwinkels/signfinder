Usage:
     trainer [image-file.jpg ...]
     For each .jpg-file to be trained, a <file>_mask.png file as generated by the
     maskMasker program must be present.

Description:
     Takes a set of labeled .jpg files, and generates a database of positive and
     negative color-histogram-samples from these files.
     .jpg-files must be labeled with binary mask in a <filename>_mask.png file with
     the same size as the original .jpg file. Data over Areas labeled with white
     will be regarded a positive sample. The rest will be regarded a negative sample.
     A database of SURF datapoints will be extracted from the white-labeled areas
     as well.

Files:
     Results are written to the following files:
     * _posHist.hist for the positive color histogram.
     * _negHist.hist for the negative color histogram.
     * _surfkeys.dat for the SURF keypoints.
     Since the signFinder program reads posHist.hist, negHist.hist, and surfkeys.dat
     for its classification, the files need to be renamed before they will be used
     by the signFinder program. This prevents the accidentally overwriting of
     existing databases.

Compile:
     type 'make'
     * The OpenCV Open Computer Vision library is a requirement.
