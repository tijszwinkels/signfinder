[progress report](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automatic_Street-Sign_Detection_and_Reading)


This is a [OpenStreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) project, sponsored by the [Google Summer of Code 2009](http://code.google.com/soc/)!

See the wiki-pages for documentation.
The current 'signFinder' executable takes .jpg images as input, and outputs result.jpg files, marking and reading each street sign like on the picture above.  Please note that this project has been designed for and trained on dutch street signs, and without adjustment it's unlikely that it'll work well on street signs from other countries.

The [dataset](http://mirror.openstreetmap.nl/openstreetphoto/tijs/dataset/) is available as well.
