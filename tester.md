tester - tests the quality of the current color-histograms on a labeled testset.

Usage:
     tester [image-file.jpg ...]
     For each .jpg-file to be tested, a <file>_mask.png file as generated by the
     maskMasker program must be present. Files for which no mask is present
     are skipped.

Description:
     The signFinder program mainly uses color-histogram-matching as a means
     to detect and segment dutch street signs. This matching can be considered
     a per-pixel binary classification. The performance of this type of
     classification is suitable to be determined by a RoC curve.

     This software takes a set of labeled .jpg files, and calculates the true
     positive and false positive rate of the current histogram matcher for many
     different thresholds. This data can be used to decide the optimal threshold,
     and can be used to generate a RoC-curve.
     This is a slow process, and can take several hours for a single run.

Files:
     Histograms are read from the following files:
     * posHist.hist for the positive color histogram.
     * negHist.hist for the negative color histogram.
     These files can be generated with the 'trainer' utility.
     Results are written to the RocCurve.dat file.

Output:
     For every threshold for every file, a line similar to this one is shown:
     **** file: image.jpg ,thr: 0.12, tp: 0.678, fp: 0.127\n"
     Showing the threshold, the true positive, and the false positives,

     On termination, the program writes aggregate statistics to both RocCurve.dat
     and stdout, in lines like this:
     Threshold   TP              TP sd           FP              FP sd
     0.12     0.678004        0.0982197       0.127092        0.129635
     showing the average true positive and false positive over all files,
     including the standard deviation. Moreover, on termination the total
     surface under the RoC-curve is written to both stdout and the file,
     this gives an indication of the performance of the binary classifier.

RoC-Curve:
    There is a gnuplot-script supplied to plot the RoC-curve.
    If there's a RocCurve.dat file, it can be plotted by starting
    gnuplot, and typing load 'modules/RocPlot.p'.
