     signFinder - finds dutch street signs in pictures

Usage:
     signFinder <image-file.jpg ...>

Description:
     This program tries to find dutch street signs in image files.
     Original images with marked street-signs are written to <filename>_result.jpg
     Additional images are written as well, showing the different stages of the 
     process.

Internals:
     Street-signs are detected as following:
     * Histogram-matching is used to mark the pixels with a distinct blue street-sign color.
       The positive and negative sample histograms are stored in the posHist.hist and negHist.hist files.
     * Blob detection is employed to segment connected regions of blue pixels into blobs.
     * Blobs with a smaller are than 1/400th of the image and blobs touching the side are pruned. 
     * Statistics are generated over the blobs. 
       currently: area, roughness, x/y ratio, width / height ratio, orientation, rougness and 'squareness'
     * Blobs are accepted and rejected based on fixed decision boundaries.
     * A convex hull is drawn around positively classified blobs for the result image.

Output:
     * For each detected blob, its statistics and whether it's accepted or rejected is displayed on stdout. 

Performance Measurement:
     * _mask.png images contain hand-labeled binary mask-images, marking where street signs are present
       in given Images. These masks can be made using the 'maskMaker' program, located elsewhere in this
       package.
     * If the program can find a _mask.png file for an image, it will automatically try to judge
       whether classification was successfull. false detections, undetected signs, and multiple detections
       of a single sign are reported to the stdout. On termination of the program, aggregate statistics are
       displayed.

Compile:
     type 'make'
     The OpenCV Open Computer Vision library is a requirement.
